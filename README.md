# Prisoner's Dilemma
This project is a C++ implementation of the classic game theory problem known as the Prisoner's Dilemma. It simulates the interactions between two players who must decide whether to cooperate or betray each other, leading to different outcomes based on their decisions.

This project was inspired by the video ["What Game Theory Reveals About Life, The Universe, and Everything"]((https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mScpHTIi-kM&t=1040s&pp=ygUKdmVyaXRhc2l1bQ%3D%3D)) by Veritasium.
