# Prisoner's Dilemma
This project is a C++ implementation of the classic game theory problem known as the Prisoner's Dilemma. It simulates the interactions between two players who must decide whether to cooperate or betray each other, leading to different outcomes based on their decisions.
<br><br>
The game follows some simple rules:<br>
- If both players cooperate, they both receive a moderate sentence.<br>
- If one player betrays while the other cooperates, the betrayer receives no sentence while the cooperator receives a severe sentence.<br>
- If both players betray each other, they both receive a moderate sentence.

This project was inspired by the video ["What Game Theory Reveals About Life, The Universe, and Everything"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mScpHTIi-kM&t=1040s&pp=ygUKdmVyaXRhc2l1bQ%3D%3D) by Veritasium.
